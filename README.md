# Medtracker

The project aims at solving problems that exist in the medicine delivery supply chain. Some of the common problems include ensuring safety of medicines during transportation. For example checking the source where the medicine was manufactured as well as monitoring temperature and humidity during transportation. 

In order to do this we make use of Ethereum smart contracts. Sensors used to monitor parameters like temperature, humidity and location are simulated using the MetaMask wallet. The data from these sensors is stored in the Ethereum Blockchain which is a timestamped list of blocks which records and aggregates data about transactions that have ever occurred within the blockchain network.

This ensures that the data is public decentralized and cannot be manipulated once on the network and gives an accurate record of the state of the medicine during delivery.
